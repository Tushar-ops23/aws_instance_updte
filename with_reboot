Changing Instance Type of a Running EC2 Instance using AWS CLI

1. Connect to your AWS account using AWS CLI by running the following command:
   aws configure

2. Stop the running instance that you want to change the instance type for. You can use the stop-instances command, specifying the instance ID of the instance you want to stop. For example:
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
   Replace i-1234567890abcdef0 with the actual instance ID of the instance you want to stop.

3. Wait for the instance to stop. You can use the describe-instances command to check the status of the instance and ensure that it has stopped. For example:
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name'

4. Once the instance has stopped, you can modify the instance type using the modify-instance-attribute command, specifying the instance ID and the new instance type you want to use. For example:
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-type t2.small
   Replace i-1234567890abcdef0 with the actual instance ID of the instance you want to modify, and t2.small with the new instance type you want to use.

5. Start the instance again using the start-instances command, specifying the instance ID of the instance you modified. For example:
   aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
   Replace i-1234567890abcdef0 with the actual instance ID of the instance you modified.

6. Once the instance has started, you can verify that the instance type has been changed using the describe-instances command. For example:
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceType'

Please note that changing the instance type of a running instance will result in a reboot of the instance, and the instance will be unavailable during the stop and start process. Make sure to plan for any potential downtime when changing the instance type.
